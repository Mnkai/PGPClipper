# PGPClipper

Use PGPClipper to easily and safely write and receive PGP messages in apps that let you copy and paste text.

PGPClipper monitors user clipboard, and notifies the user when possible PGP data is available for decoding. You can also use NFC token or fingerprint (key password must be stored (encrypted) in app for this function) to decrypt/sign/encrypt texts.
